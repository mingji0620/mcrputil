Minecraft Resource Pack Util for encrypting and decrypting resource packs.

## Usage

mcrputil is a command-line tool, and does not have a GUI.

```
Usage: mcrputil <COMMAND>

Commands:
  encrypt  Encrypts the folder with a given or auto-generated key
  decrypt  Decrypts the folder with a given key
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help information
```

### Encryption

```
Usage: mcrputil encrypt [OPTIONS] <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

Arguments:
  <INPUT>   Input folder
  <OUTPUT>  Output folder

Options:
  -k, --key <KEY>          Key used for encryption
  -e, --exclude <EXCLUDE>  Specifies files which should not be encrypted
  -h, --help               Print help information
```

#### Step-by-step

1. Make sure your pack is unzipped, and in your pack directory should be a manifest.json
2. ./mcrputil encrypt \<path to your unzipped pack directory> \<path to your unzipped pack/output directory>
3. A contents.json should now be in your pack/output directory, the key will be displayed in the console after "Encryption finished, key: \<your key>"
4. Zip your output directory contents (not the directory itself), and copy your key depending on the software used to \<your pack zip file>.key.

For integration into build automation systems, it might be easier to use the --key command line argument with an own supplied key.

### Decryption

```
Usage: mcrputil decrypt [OPTIONS] <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

Arguments:
  <INPUT>   Input folder
  <OUTPUT>  Output folder

Options:
  -k, --key <KEY>  Key used for decryption
  -h, --help       Print help information
```
